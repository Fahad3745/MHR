        <h4><b>John Stevenson</b></h4>
        <p>CEO of Midshire Heritage Railway
            Hi my name is John and I am delighted to say that I am the CEO of such a great company. I believe that over the years we have vastly improved as a company and 
            our branches have expanded over the years and also the number of employees have increased as many people start to see a career in our great company. One story I would 
            like to share about myself is about how I had started this company from absolutely nothing, as I had completed university my future wasnt quite clear to me and unfortunately
            I struggled a lot because of this but one day a certain idea came to me I had been lent 50,000 Great British Pounds by my grandfather and he had always dreamt of openeing
            his own railway company and I told him that one day we would be successful and ensure we would create one of the best railway companies to ever exist and now here we are as one of the best railway companies it all started with a grandson fulfilling his grandfathers dreams.

        <h4><b>Rachel Smith</b></h4>
        <p>Ticket officer - hello my name is Rachel and I have been a satisfied employee at Midshire Heritage Railway for 9 years and I believe that I havent been treated so well
            in any other work environment like how I am treated here and all the other employees are great at socialising and really make you feel at home whilst most importantly 
            ensuring they complete all tasks set by the Manager. Overall It is great and I love working in this great environment.
